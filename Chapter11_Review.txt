Chapter 11 Review

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Why is I/O tricky for a programmer?
   Because there are multiple methods of reading/writing to a file.

2) What does the notation << hex do?
   it changes a istream/ostream to either accept hex input or write
   using hex output


3) What are hexadecimal numbers used for in computer science? Why?
   Hexadecimal is usually used at the hardware level (such as memory, pointers)
   due to the fact that two hex digits can be used to represent a byte.

4) Name some of the options you may want to implement for formatting integer
output.
	You can use hex, dec, and oct to transform input/output into hexadecimal,
	decimal and octal bases.
	Using setw(), you can set the width that a number can take up.

5) What is an manipulator?
   A manipulator is a means of changing the behavior of iostream into accepting
   different types of input and output.

6) What is the prefix for decimal? For octal? For hexadecimal?
   Dec, oct and hex respectively. 


7) What is the default output format for floating-point values?
   defaultfloat

8) What is a field?
   A field is a ways to format integer values 

9) Explain what setprecision() and setw() do.
   setprecision() changes the number of digits a floating-number can take up:
   These include the following:
   	 Using setprecision() on a defaultfloat sets the max number of digits it
	 can take up.

	 Using setprecision() on a fixed or scientific sets the max number of digits
	 past the digit mark(decimal point)

	 Using setw() changes the amount of space an integer/char/string can take up.
	 It must be used before each argument since does not persist like setprecision()
	 does.

10) What is the purpose of file open modes?
    The purpose of a file open mode is to allow the user to choose how
    ifstream/fstream/ofstream manipulates a file.

11) Which of the following manipulators does not "stick" : hex, scientific,
setprecision(), showbase, setw?
    setw() is not persistent.
		
		

12) What is the difference between character I/O and binary I/O ?
    Character I/O converts characters from a file into the specified
    data type, while binary I/O treats each byte at the binary level
    (i.e with no sort of formatting)
    

13) Give an example of when it would probably be beneficial to use a binary file
instead of a text file.

    An example of when it would be benefical to use a binary file would be if
    you are dealing with data such as an image file/audio file, 


14) Give two examples where a stringstream can be useful.
    When you want to read an integer/double from a string
    Formatting input from an ifstream/fstream
    Creating a string to be passed as an function argument


15) What is a file position?
    A file position is a pointer that points to a location in a file (I mean in bytes).
    Since C++ treats a file as a series of bytes, the pointer moves to either a specific
    byte or moved due to istream/ostream

16) What happens if you position a file position beyond the end of file (EOF)?
    Honestly, its unexpected behavior that is handled by the operating system.
    For example, I've seen that (on Ubuntu 18.04) that it just spits out garbage
    characters.

17) When would you prefer line-oriented input to type-specific input?
    If you need to preserve all bytes in a file(without whitespace and all) without
    cin removing whitespace/escape characters


18) What does isalnum(c) do?
    isalnum checks if a character is either a alphabetical character or numerical.
