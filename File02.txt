if you want a horror story, there's a chip on motherboards (in case of amd it's psp and
in case of intel it's ime) that, if hacked, allows invisible persistent control over
your pc or laptop. these are used for remote administration when your server far away
isn't starting so you need to connect to the box without os. oh, and there's no way
to detect if that thing is hacked or misused.

when people show a terminal in trailers it's almost always something funny.
i vividly remember watch dogs 2 trailer where "hacker" characters had a terminal open where they
did `sudo apt-get install` (which is a basic application installation command for
ubuntu) and then `rm profile`. which would mean that their hacking is installing
minesweeper on their computer and then deleting a file (from their own computer).

as for some basic knowledge, your pc consists of several things. firmware, bios, uefi is
how your hardware works. then comes in your os kernel - a thing that allocates your
hardware resources to different tasks. then there's a bootloader/partition table - a way
for computer to tell where and how your files are stored and where your system is
located. drivers provide a way for applications to use hardware to its full potential.
then there are services and daemons - small programs that always run on the background,
they will notify you if your disk space runs out for example. then there's root/
administrator level - a way for user layer programs to have full access to protected
stuff on your pc. then there's user level - programs run in a (theoretically) safe
environment with restrictions that don't allow them to do a lot of damage.
