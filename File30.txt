If you want a horror story, there's a chip on motherboards (in case of AMD it's PSP and
in case of Intel it's IME) that, if hacked, allows invisible persistent control over
your PC or laptop. These are used for remote administration when your server far away
isn't starting so you need to connect to the box without OS. Oh, and there's no way
to detect if that thing is hacked or misused.
