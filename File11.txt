If you want a horror story  there s a chip on motherboards  in case of AMD it s PSP and
in case of Intel it s IME  that  if hacked  allows invisible persistent control over
your PC or laptop  These are used for remote administration when your server far away
isn t starting so you need to connect to the box without OS  Oh  and there s no way
to detect if that thing is hacked or misused 

When people show a terminal in trailers it s almost always something funny 
I vividly remember watch dogs 2 trailer where "hacker" characters had a terminal open where they
did  sudo apt get install   which is a basic application installation command for
ubuntu  and then  rm profile   Which would mean that their hacking is installing
minesweeper on their computer and then deleting a file  from their own computer  

As for some basic knowledge  your PC consists of several things  Firmware  BIOS  UEFI is
how your hardware works  Then comes in your OS Kernel   a thing that allocates your
hardware resources to different tasks  Then there s a bootloader partition table   a way
for computer to tell where and how your files are stored and where your system is
located  Drivers provide a way for applications to use hardware to its full potential 
Then there are services and daemons   small programs that always run on the background 
they will notify you if your disk space runs out for example  Then there s root 
administrator level   a way for user layer programs to have full access to protected
stuff on your PC  Then there s user level   programs run in a  theoretically  safe
environment with restrictions that don t allow them to do a lot of damage
